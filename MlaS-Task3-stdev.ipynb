    "### Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "_Standard deviation_ (SD) is a statistical concept, with a wide range of application, to measure how the data is spread out around the mean. [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/standard-deviation) defines it as \"a measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is defined as a square root of the average of the squared differences from the Mean [Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Standard Deviation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Comparison_standard_deviations.svg) Image source: [Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comparison_standard_deviations.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Population and sample SD\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methods of calculating the standard deviation. One that refers to the entire population and the other that consider the data set as a sample of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation of population** ($\\sigma$), is a measure that could be accurately calculated if the values of the variable were known for all population units; corresponds to the deviation of a random variable whose distribution is identical to the distribution in the population. This kind of standard deviation is often referred as to unbiased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the formula for population standard deviation ([Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ denotes population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation of sample** ($s$), is a measure that estimates the standard deviation in a population based on the knowledge of only some of its objects, i.e. the random sample. This kind of standard deviation is often referred as to biased or corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the formula for sample standard deviation ([Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\bar{x}$ denotes sample mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Microsoft Excel's functions `STDEC.S` and `STDEV.P` are used to calculate standard deviation of **sample** and **population** respectively.\n"
