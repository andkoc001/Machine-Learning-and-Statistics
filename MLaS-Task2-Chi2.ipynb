    "### The Chi-squared test\n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test is a statistical tool suitable for categorical data values (for instance, colour or academic degree or dog breeds). It can be used for three applications, although in essence they test similar things: 1) the goodness of fit test (how one category data fits the distribution), 2) test for homogeneity (liekehood of different samples coming from the same population) and 3) test of independence. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, Chi-squared **Test of independence** applies. Test of independence attempts to answer whether being a member of one category is independent of another is statistically significant. In other words, \"the chi-square independence test is a procedure for testing if two categorical variables are related in some population.\" [SPSS Tutorials](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation compares the measured (observed) values against the expected values (if the null hypothesis is true).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the chi-squared test is a numerical value that can be interpreted in such a way that it allows for seeing whether one variable is independent of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generic form of the test is like this (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_tes)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\chi}^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\\ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "$ n $ - number of categories,  \n",
    "$ O $ - measurement from observation,  \n",
    "$ E $ - expected value if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also 'degrees of freedom' is required for assessing the independence test. The general formula for the degrees of freedom for tabularised data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d = (r-1)(c-1) $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where:  \n",
    "$ d $ - degrees of freedom,  \n",
    "$ r $ - number of rows,  \n",
    "$ c $ - number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of freedom will affect the chi-squared distribution. Sample plots for various degrees of freedom are shown below.\n",
