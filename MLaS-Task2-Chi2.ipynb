    "### The Chi-squared test\n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test is a statistical tool suitable for categorical data values (for instance, colour or academic degree or dog breeds). It can be used for three applications, although in essence they test similar things: 1) the goodness of fit test (how one category data fits the distribution), 2) test for homogeneity (liekehood of different samples coming from the same population) and 3) test of independence. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, Chi-squared **Test of independence** applies. Test of independence attempts to answer whether being a member of one category is independent of another is statistically significant. In other words, \"the chi-square independence test is a procedure for testing if two categorical variables are related in some population.\" [SPSS Tutorials](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation compares the measured (observed) values against the expected values (if the null hypothesis is true).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the chi-squared test is a numerical value that can be interpreted in such a way that it allows for seeing whether one variable is independent of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generic form of the test is like this (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_tes)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\chi}^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\\ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "$ n $ - number of categories,  \n",
    "$ O $ - measurement from observation,  \n",
    "$ E $ - expected value if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that, in order to render the independence test viable, the expected value $ E_k > 5 $. Although that value is assumed arbitrarily, it is commonly used for practical application (-----quote source here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also 'degrees of freedom' is required for assessing the independence test. The general formula for the degrees of freedom for tabularised data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d = (r-1)(c-1) $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where:  \n",
    "$ d $ - degrees of freedom,  \n",
    "$ r $ - number of rows,  \n",
    "$ c $ - number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree of freedom will affect the chi-squared distribution. Sample plots for various degrees of freedom are shown below.\n",

    "This task is to evaluate the given example data along the Chi-squared test result also already given. \"The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables are independent. The Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) gives the table below as an example, stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use `scipy.stats` to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "From the data provided by the survey, there is not an evidence strong enough to conclude (within reason) that {the distribution of the 'collar colours' among the neighborhoods} is due to the relationship between the person's neighborhood of residence and the person's occupational classification (null hypothesis is true). In other words, the proportion of a certain 'collar colour' is not equal to the proportion of the neighborhood. There is no relationship between the two categorical variables - they are independent. The collated data may be just because of the sampling variability. "
