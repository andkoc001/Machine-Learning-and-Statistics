    "* Task 2 - Verify the value of the $ 𝜒2 $ (chi-squared) test for a sample dataset and calculate the associated $ 𝑝 $ value.\n",
    "* Task 3 - Simulate Excel function STDEC.S and STDEV.P using Numpy and explain advantages of the former.\n",

    "Then in the next iteration new boundary conditions are assumed. If the test is true, $ \\frac{1+x}{2} $ becomes the right boundary; if the test is false, $ \\frac{1+x}{2} $ becomes the left boundary. This way, the range tightens at each iteration. \n",

    "The chi-squared test is a statistical tool suitable for categorical data values (for instance, colour or academic degree or dog breeds). It can be used for three applications, although in essence they test similar things: 1) the goodness of fit test (how one category data fits the distribution), 2) test for homogeneity (liekehood of different samples coming from the same population) and 3) test of independence. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_cs1YlZoug). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, Chi-squared **Test of independence** applies. Test of independence attempts to answer whether being a member of one category is independent of another is statistically significant. In other words, \"the chi-square independence test is a procedure for testing if two categorical variables are related in some population.\" [SPSS Tutorials](https://www.spss-tutorials.com/chi-square-independence-test/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation compares the measured (observed) values against the expected values (if the null hypothesis is true).\n",

    "The result of the chi-squared test is a numerical value that can be interpreted in such a way that it allows for seeing whether one variable is independent of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generic form of the test is like this (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_tes)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ {\\chi}^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_k - E_k)^2}{E_k}\\ $$\n",

    "$ O $ - measurement from observation,  \n",

    "\n",
    "It is also worth noting that, in order to render the independence test viable, the expected value $ E_k > 5 $. Although that value is assumed arbitrarily, it is commonly used for practical application (-----quote source here).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also 'degrees of freedom' is required for assessing the independence test. The general formula for the degrees of freedom for tabularised data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "_Standard deviation_ (SD) is a statistical concept, with a wide range of application, to measure how the data is spread out around the mean. [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/standard-deviation) defines it as \"a measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is defined as a square root of the average of the squared differences from the Mean [Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html).\n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Population and sample SD\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methods of calculating the standard deviation. One that refers to the entire population and the other that consider the data set as a sample of the population. For simplicity, only discrete values are consider in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation of population** ($\\sigma$), is a measure that could be accurately calculated if the values of the variable were known for all population units; corresponds to the deviation of a random variable whose distribution is identical to the distribution in the population. This kind of standard deviation is often referred as to unbiased or uncorrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the formula for population standard deviation ([Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\mu)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:  \n",
    "$N$ is the size of the population,\n",
    "$x_i$ represents the observed value of the i-th member,\n",
    "$\\mu$ denotes population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **standard deviation of sample** ($s$), is a measure that estimates the standard deviation in a population based on the knowledge of only some of its objects, i.e. the random sample. For practical reasons this method is often the only viable option. This kind of standard deviation is often referred as to biased or corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The the formula for sample standard deviation ([Mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation-formulas.html)):\n",

    "\n",
    "NumPy library for Python allows for calculating the standard deviation The function `numpy.std()` is used for this purpose. The syntax employed for the calculation takes the following form:  \n",
    "`std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))`  \n",
    "where x is value of an observation.\n",

In standard statistical practice, ddof=1 provides an unbiased estimator of the variance of the infinite population. ddof=0 provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of the estimated variance, so even with ddof=1, it will not be an unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se\" ([NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.std.html))."
