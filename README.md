## Introduction

This repository documents my research, progress and findings on the assgiment for Machine Learning and Statistics module, Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, 2020. Lecturer: dr Ian McLoughlin

### Assignment  delivery

The project is delivered via this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics.git).

The repository holds solutions to the tasks required for the project assignment. Each solution is presnted in a form of Jupyter Notebooks, separate for each task. See below for the list of the tasks and corresponding notebook.

In the notebooks I have incorporated the research and described the tasks progress. It is illustrated the applied concepts and methods together with relevant code snippets. The notebook includes also the calculated outputs and plots with accompanied description. Finally, inside the notebook I have included also references to sources being consulted for this assignment.

Note that this repository (solutuion to the tasks) is only a portion of the module assignment. The other part is a project available in a separate GitHub [repository](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project.git).

### Viewing the Notebook

For viewing the notebook online, it is recommended to use Jupyter Notebooks viewer, [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Paste the link to the notebook to be inspected into provided field.

## Tasks

This section comprises of the following tasks.

The detailed instruction to the tasks can be found in this [file](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics/blob/main/assessment(2).pdf).

### Task 1

> Print on screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places.

The solution of the task is presented in the [Square root of 2](https://github.com/andkoc001/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics/blob/main/MLaS-Task1-sqrt2.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook.


### Task 2
